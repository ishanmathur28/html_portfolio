    My first two year experiance in the college was great.I was the member of five societies 
    in the very first year(EDC,MARS,LINUX USER GROUP,ADVENTURE CLUB,TOASTMASTERS CLUB).I learnt alot 
    from all of them .In my second year I became the member of the executive commitee of Thapar  Toastmasters 
    Club and hold the position of sergeant-at-arms.I also became the core member of 
    Linux user group(LUG).Being a toastmaster I learnt alot regarding speaking skills and overcoming stage fear.As a part of LUG I gained knowledge on Web Dev,DSA,AI and other technical aspects.
    Now I am in third year and hoping to learn  more.......
